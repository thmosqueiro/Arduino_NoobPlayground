Leaky Integratino
===

The idea is to develop a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron module with
temperature dependence and a current clamp.

The current is controlled by a simple (four-legs) switch. It's
amplitued is controlled via software and read through a digital pin.

Usage
---

Just upload the .ino code into arduino, mount a simple circuit (pic,
no source available now -- too simple!) and use the python companion
script to plot it on your computer.
